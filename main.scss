/* Base
The base directory contains styles that help start a project. The base 
directory could contain the following type of SASS files 							*/
@import "04-base/settings";

/* Partials
The partials directory will probably contain the bulk of your SASS files. 
A page may consist of multiple partials and should be styled individually. 
These partials may include files like:
	--Header 
	--Footer
	--Navigation 
	--Content Block 												  				*/

@import "02-partials/header";

/* Components
For smaller components, there is the components. 
While partials/ and pages/ is kind of macro (defining the global wireframe), components/ 
is more micro. It can contain all kinds of specific modules like a slider, a loader, 
a widget, or anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ 
since your site is should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
	--Media
	--Carousel
	--Section
	--Accordion												  						*/
@import "01-components/global"; /* Smaller components */



/* Pages 
If you have page-specific styles, I think it’s cool to put them in a pages/ folder and in a 
file named after the page. For example, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for 
the home page, so you’d have a _home.scss file in pages/ dealing with this. 
    --Home
	--Article
	--Blog
